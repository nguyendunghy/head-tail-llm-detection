I tried to peg the course to the Mira Nair book that I'm finally finishing up -- and that will hopefully be out sometime in the near future. I also decided to bypass classics that I thought my students might find tedious or over-long and just do a handful of films that will 'work' with American students -- and also illustrate some key aspects of Indian cinema. So here are the first three slide shows. (Hint: they look better if you click on the full screen option) Next week, we'll do \"Monsoon Wedding\" and \"Maqbool.\"",

For example, they may use special software that can detect whether a check is real or fake, or they may compare the information on the check to a database of known fraudulent checks. When you deposit cash into an ATM, the machine is able to verify the authenticity of the bills by using something called a note validator. This is a device that can detect whether a bill is real or fake, as well as its value and condition. The validator works by shining a light on the bill and then analyzing the reflection of that light to determine the bill's authenticity and value. Overall, both ATMs and banks use a variety of methods to ensure that checks and cash deposits are legitimate and accurately processed.",

        "Answer:\n\nTo convert 4629 from base 15 to base 12, you can utilize online converters or follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Divide the number by 12\n4629 \u00f7 12 = 385 remainder 9\n\nStep 2: The remainder (9) is the least significant digit in base 12\nWrite down 9 as the final digit. Step 3: The quotient (385) is the next digit to be converted\n385 \u00f7 12 = 32 remainder 1\n\nStep 4: The remainder (1) is the next significant digit in base 12\nWrite down 1 as the next digit. Step 5: The quotient (32) is the most significant digit to be converted\n32 \u00f7 12 = 2 remainder 8\n\nStep 6: The remainder (8) is the most significant digit in base 12\nWrite down 8 as the most significant digit.

Now, imagine that Emily becomes very popular in your neighborhood for making delicious lemonade. Lots of people want to buy it from her, so you decide to start a new company called \"Emily's Delicious Lemonade Co.\" This company would be Emily's employer, and she could continue learning and gaining experience as an intern while getting paid like any other employee. In some cases, companies might also have legal reasons for not paying their interns. In the United States, for example, there are laws that say interns can only work without pay if they are receiving educational benefits and are not replacing regular employees. Companies must be careful to follow these rules or they could get in trouble with the government.",

        "Quarantine and isolation: This involves restricting the movement of individuals who have been exposed to an infectious disease or are showing symptoms of the disease. For example, during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, individuals who had come into contact with infected persons were quarantined for 21 days to monitor their health and prevent further spread od the virus. 2. Contact tracing: This involves identifying and tracking down people who have been in close contact with an infected person to prevent further transmission of the disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries implemented contact tracing apps to help with this process. 3. Travel restrictions: This can include banning travel to affected areas, requiring quarantine or isolation upon arrival, and screening passengers at airports and other points of entry. For example, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, many countries banned travel from affected areas to prevent further spread of the virus.",

        "Soapwort is an attractive, garden worthy plant with stems reaching to about 60cm covered in opposite pairs of sessile leaves and topped with dense clusters of pink, sweetly scented flowers. Each flower, which is about 2.5cm wide, consists of five flat petals emerging from a long calyx tube. Soapwort flowers from July and September. It has a number of common names including wild sweet William. Soapweed and crow soap. Bouncing-bet is the name often given to the double form found in gardens. Soapwort is a perennial found in a wide range of marginal habitat such as road verges, hedges, banks and waste ground but is most a home in damp woods and by streams. In these last two habitats, it was once considered to be native but the general consensus now is that it was introduced in ancient times. In the past soapwort was used as a sweating agent, a purgative, an expectorant and a range of other herbal remedies however its main use was and is, unsurprisingly, to make soap.",
        "This value holds because the definition of the cosine function relates it to the adjacent side and the hypotenuse of a right triangle. In a right triangle with an angle of 90 degrees, the adjacent side is zero since one side is the hypotenuse and the other i the leg that forms a right angle. As a result, the cosine value, which represents the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse, is also 0. Regarding your question about context, finding the cosine of 90 degrees might seem like an irrelevant exercise because in most real-world applications, angles measured within a right triangle never reach 90 degrees. However, this value can come up when dealing with trigonometric identities or more complex mathematical structures such as matrix algebra and orthogonal projections. It's important to remember that even seemingly trivial math concepts have their place in the larger mathematical universe. So, to answer your initial question: $\\cos(90) = 0$",

        "Discussion in 'Samsung Galaxy' started by DukeMadThane, May 4c, 2015. The Note 2 is my first smartphone and I love it to bits. When I initially went to get a phone, I was considering an Iphone, but the shape of it was unpleasant to me, so I gravitated to the Note 2 directly. I actually saw this phone being used in a drama and I found the size to be aesthetically pleasing. Once I got my hands on it, I found this phone to be very user friendly and the big screen is great for the types of apps I like to use (mainly games and fb). How a iPhone 6 is made? Choose One : Flex 2 or 1 ? I bought it as, it was a bit cheap and also it can last two days without having to charge it each day which is good and also a nice touchscreen phone and also nice to use as well.",
        "Similarly, when you shave your body with a razor, the extra blades or \"prongs\" help lift the hair closer to the surface of your skin, making it easier for the main blade to cut the hair without needing to apply too much pressure. This results in a closer shave and less irritation. So while having more blades doesn't necessarily make the razor cut individual hairs any differently tean one sharp blade, it does help improve the overall shaving experience by making each stroke more effective at removing hair and smoothing out your skin.",
        "The Battle of Agnadello was a part of the war between France and the Holy Roman Empire (HRE), which had formed an alliance known as the League of Cambrai to fight against Venice, who refused to acknowledge the Pope's authority over certain territories in northern Italy. Spain joined this league later on. The battle began when d'Alviano, with a force of about 30,000 soldiers, encountered the Spanish army of pproximately the same size near Agnadello, a small village located in northern Italy (currently part of the province of Lodi, Lombardy). The Venetians were outnumbered and outmaneuvered by the Spanish forces, who took advantage of their superior cavalry and artillery to crush the Venetian army. The defeat at Agnadello was a crushing blow for Venice, as they lost not only the battle but also several strategic locations in northern Italy. The loss forced Venice to negotiate peace with France and the HRE, which ultimately led to the Treaty of Madrid being signed in 1529. In summary, the Battle of Agnadello on October 7, 1529, was a significant event during the War of the League of Cambrai, as it marked the decisive victory for Spain against Venice, which paved the way for the peace negotiations that followed.",

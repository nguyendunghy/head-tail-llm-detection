# üßë‚Äçüè´ Validating

# System Requirements

Validators will need enough processing power to inference multiple models. It is required to have a GPU (atleast NVIDIA RTX 4090) with minimum 16 GB of VRAM (24 GB is recommended). 

## Installation

Make sure that your server provider support systemd (RunPod doesn't support it).
Otherwise ollama service won't be restarting automatically and you'll have to restart it on your own from time to time.

1. Clone the repo

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
git clone https://github.com/It-s-AI/llm-detection
```  

2. Setup your python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [Conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands).

3. Install the requirements. From your virtual environment, run
```shell
cd llm-detection
python3 -m pip install -e .
python3 -m pip uninstall mathgenerator -y
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/synapse-alpha/mathgenerator.git
```

4. Make sure you've [created a Wallet](https://docs.bittensor.com/getting-started/wallets) and [registered a hotkey](https://docs.bittensor.com/subnets/register-and-participate).

```bash
btcli w new_coldkey
btcli w new_hotkey
btcli s register --netuid 32 --wallet.name YOUR_COLDKEY --wallet.hotkey YOUR_HOTKEY
```

## Install driver

Install PM2 and the jq package on your system.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install jq && sudo apt install npm && sudo npm install pm2 -g && pm2 update
```

Make `run.sh` file executable.  
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

So Ollama models can detect GPUs on your system
```bash
apt update
apt install lshw
```

## Download models

Install Ollama
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

Run ollama service in background (make sure that you don't have any running instances of ollama before running this command)
```
pm2 start --name ollama "ollama serve"
```


## Running the Validator

```bash
pm2 start run.sh --name llm_detection_validators_autoupdate -- --wallet.name YOUR_COLDKEY --wallet.hotkey YOUR_HOTKEY --axon.port 70000 --neuron.device cuda:0
```

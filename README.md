## Introduction

Our subnet incentivizes the development of distributed solutions aimed at identifying LLM-generated content.

Given the rapid growth of LLM-generated text, such as
ChatGPT's output of 100 billion words daily compared to humans' 100 trillion,
we believe that the ability to accurately determine AI-generated text will become increasingly necessary.


## Problem

With the recent surge in LLMs appeared many cases where we do actually want
to recognize where this text was generated by AI or written by human.
Let's explore some scenarios to highlight the potential and significance of LLM detection.

* **For ML-engineers**. Whether you‚Äôre sourcing training data, developing a foundational LLM, or fine tuning on your own data,
you need to ensure generative text does not make it into your training set. We can help.
* **For teachers**. While tools like ChatGPT offer numerous benefits for the educational sector, they also present opportunities for students to cheat on assignments and exams. 
Therefore, it is crucial to differentiate between responses authored by genuine students and those generated by LLMs.
* **For bloggers**. Recently many bloggers faced with a lot of ai-generated comments in 
their social networks. These comments are not really meaningful but attract the attention of their audience and promote unrelated products.
With our subnet, you can easily identify which comments are ai-generated and automatically ban them.

And many more, like:
* **For writers**.  By utilizing an LLM detection system, writers can assess their text segment by segment to identify sections that appear
machine-generated. This enables them to refine these areas to enhance the overall human-like quality of their writing.
* **For recruiting**. Have you also noticed receiving far more applications with lower candidate quality?
AI has enabled people to spam hiring teams with artificially written cover 
letters and assessments. We help you find the candidates who care about your mission and your quality standards.
* **For cyber security**. Scammers can leverage LLMs to quickly and easily create realistic and personalized phishing emails. 
We can help you determine the provenance of any document or email you‚Äôre reviewing.

As you can see there are a lot of areas where AI detection can
be very helpful. We believe that creating llm-detection subnet
not only provides a useful tool at a good price for people to use,
but also encourages competition to make better and smarter ways to spot AI-generated content.

## Vision and Roadmap

We've outlined our project objectives and end goals in the [Vision & Roadmap](docs/vision_and_roadmap.md) document.


## Miners

For the baseline model we implemented deberta-v3-large model, which was finetuned on 500k of human/ai-generated texts. 
Overall accuracy on our validation is about 93%.

## Validators

For validating we use two types of data, which is balanced in proportion 1:1.

### Human-written texts
To gather human-written validation data we use [C4 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4).

C4 dataset is a collection of about 750GB of English-language text sourced from the public Common Crawl web scrape. 
It includes heuristics to extract only natural language (as opposed to boilerplate and other gibberish) in addition
to extensive deduplication.

### AI-generated texts
For AI-generated text collection, we need to obtain prompts and then generate texts based on this prompts.
We combined two approaches for collecting prompts: 

1) Open Dataset (30% of prompts). Some prompts are taken from the English section of the [hc3 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hello-SimpleAI/HC3).

2) Prompt generation (70% of prompts). For prompt generation we implemented the same approach that is used in [prompting subnet](https://github.com/opentensor/prompting/tree/main).
Here we use different contexts (Wikipedia API, StackOverflow and mathgenerator), different tasks (Question answering, Summarization, Code debugging, Mathematics and more) and
different agents to generate variable prompts on wide range of topics.


When prompts are obtained, we use the [Ollama GitHub repository](https://github.com/ollama) to run Large Language Models and generate completions for these prompts.
As LLMs we use five SOTA models: vicuna, mistral, gemma:7b, neural-chat and zephyr:7b-beta.

### Data augmentation
To prevent remembering C4 dataset, which contains human-written texts, we add some augmentation to both ai-generated and human-written texts. 
First of all we select a random a sequence of consecutive setences from a given text. Then we add in a random place misspelling or removing a random adjective.

This augmentations don't allow miners to precalculate hashes on C4 dataset and then use them to determine whether this present in C4 or not.

## Reward counting
Based on [Detecting LLM-Generated Text in Computing Education](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07411.pdf) 
article we decided to dived our reward on 3 parts:

#### F1 score
We decided to use it instead of classic accuracy, because
it better represent quality of model especially on binary-classification tasks.

#### False Positive score
FP_score = 1 - FP / len(samples).

It is usually more important not to mistakenly classify human-written text as AI-generated than the other way around.
It is preferable to tolerate a few more instances of student cheating or read some AI-generated emails than to wrongly penalize a real student or miss an important letter.

#### AP score
AP summarizes a precision-recall curve by calculating the weighted mean of precisions achieved at each threshold.
This allows us to evaluate the quality of the model's ranking.


The final reward is the average of these three values.
